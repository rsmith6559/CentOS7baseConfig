# CentOS7baseConfig
Basic configuration for a new generic CentOS7 machine for Ansible.

Download as is, keeping the directory structure, change the hosts in centos7baseConfig.yaml and run it with

ansible-playbook /path/to/where/you/put/it/centos7baseConfig.yaml

I've just been playing around with this on a couple of virtual machines. It gave me the results I expected, YMMV.
